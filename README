msprng: A pseudo-random number generator on the MSP430

msprng is a program for using a MSP430G2xxx mcu as a pseudo-random number
generator.  Note that this is not a hardware random number generator,
and is not suitable for cryptographic purposes.  If you want a higher
quality source of random bits, use multiple MSP430s with different seeds,
then XOR the output from them.

Communication is via SPI, with a seperate IO line for flow control.
For specifics on the protocol, check the source code.
